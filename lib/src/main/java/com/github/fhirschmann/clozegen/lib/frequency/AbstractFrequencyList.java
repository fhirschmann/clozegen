/**
 * Base class for all Frequency Distribution Lists.
 * <p>
 * This base class allows you to load a list of frequencies from an XML
 * file. These XML files must be of the following nature:
 * <pre>
 * <frequencies>
 *     <frequency value="1234" ... />
 *     <frequency value="4563" ... />
 * </frequencies>
 * </pre>
 * The only required xml attribute here is the "value" attribute which indicates
 * how many times the subject has occurred. You can add as many attributes
 * as you like and process them in processChild(), so the population
 * of the frequencies with ValueCount<T> is up to you.
