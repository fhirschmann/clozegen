A cloze test (also cloze deletion test) is an exercise, test, or
assessment consisting of a portion of text with certain words
removed (cloze text), where the participant is asked to replace
the missing words. Cloze tests require the ability to understand
context and vocabulary in order to identify the correct words or
type of words that belong in the deleted passages of a text. This
exercise is commonly administered for the assessment of native
and second language learning and instruction.
