About ClozeGen
==============

ClozeGen is a toolkit for the generation of
[Cloze Tests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloze_test)
from arbitrary text based upon 
[DKPro](http://code.google.com/p/dkpro-core-asl/),
[UIMAfit](http://code.google.com/p/uimafit/),
and [UIMA](http://uima.apache.org).

Its targeted audience is twofold: Developers will find
a simple yet powerful platform to develop, test and deploy
their algorithms for gap generation. Users will find an
easy-to-use application for the generation of cloze tests
featuring two user interfaces.

Please note that ClozeGen is as of now not a complete collection
for the generation of cloze tests because it does not yet
ship with a variety of gap generation algorithms. Right now,
it can only generate gaps for prepositions.
