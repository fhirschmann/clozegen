About ClozeGen
==============

ClozeGen is a toolkit for the generation of
[Cloze Test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloze_test)
from arbitrary text.

This framework is mainly meant to be used by developers wishing to
implement state-of-the-art cloze test generation algorithms
not worrying about the underlying framework
[UIMA](http://uima.apache.org) or user interfaces.

In addition to providing the means to wire up generation
algorithms, developers benefit from a graphical user
interface as well as a command line interface for the
cloze test generation process.

ClozeGen supports multiple import formats (plain text and pdf
as of now) and multiple output formats (intermediate format,
plain text, latex).
