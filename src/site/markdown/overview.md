============

The following pictures shows the architectural overview

Steps in the process:

1. Read an input `text` (from plain text, pdf)
2. Translate `text` into the internal representation ([UIMA](http://uima.apache.org))
2. Activate one or more Gap Generators
3. Translate the internal representation into the Intermediate Format (let the user adjust the result)
4. Reverse the last step
5. Export to Plain Text or LaTeX

Intermediate Format
-------------------

One vital part in the process explained above is the socalled
`Intermediate Format`. The `IM` is an easy-to-use text-based
format so that the user can alter, adjust and improve the
gaps generated by the underlying algorithms. The `IM` looks
as follows:
