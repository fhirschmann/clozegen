Graphical User Interface Manual

    The graphical user interface let's you generate and edit cloze tests with
    ease. You can start it by invoking

---
java -jar clozegen-gui-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
---

    You are then shown the following window:

    \
    You can start the generation process by selecting <<Generate>>
    from the <<File>> menu. You will now be presented the following
    window:

[./images/gui/b.png]

    \
    Needless to say, you can browse for a file from which the cloze
    test should be generated from. This can be, for example, a plain
    text file. Once you have found something to generate a test for,
    activate one or more generators. Please note that if you activate
    more than one generator for a certain word class, only the first
    one will be used.

    When you click the <<Generate>> button, you'll be receive a result
    like the one below:

    The gaps which are enabled will be highlighted in green, while the
    disabled gaps will be highlighted in red. You can enable/disable a
    gap by moving the caret over it and pressing <<<Ctrl + T>>>,
    selecting <<Toggle Gap>> from the <<Edit>> menu, or simply postfixing
    the gap with a <d>:

    Once you're done editing your cloze test, can can save (export) it to
    a format of your choice by pressing <<<Ctrl + S>>> or selecting <<Save>>
    from the <<File>> menu.
