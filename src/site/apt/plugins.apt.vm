Plugins

    ClozeGen provides a simple yet powerful plugin system.

* Writing Plugins

** Background

    Clozegen is powered by three
    {{{./apidocs/com/github/fhirschmann/clozegen/lib/register/Registers.html}Register}}:
    
    * The <<Annotator Register>> contains information in order to lazily create
    AnalysisEngines which are meant to annotate words with
    {{{./apidocs/com/github/fhirschmann/clozegen/lib/type/GapAnnotation.html}GapAnnotations}}. This would normally be your generator you created
    in the {{{./tutorial.html}tutorial}}.
    
    * The <<Reader Register>> contains information in order to lazily create a
    CollectionReader.
    
    * The <<Writer Register>> contains information in order to lazily create
    JCasConsumer which write the JCas to a file.

* Writing Plugins

    The plugin system uses Java's
    {{{http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html}ServiceLoader}}.
    
    You should first create a class which implements the
    {{{./apidocs/com/github/fhirschmann/clozegen/lib/plugins/api/Plugin.html}Plugin}} Interface. Once you've done so, create a file named
    <<<src/main/resources/META-INF/services/com.github.fhirschmann.clozegen.lib.plugins.api.Plugin>>>
    in your plugin folder and write the full Java path
    of your plugin in it. For example, this might be
    <<<com.me.clozegen.plugins.FooPlugin>>>.
    
    In your plugin's <<<init()>>> method, you may register
    your extension with any of the three register described
    above.

* Writing an Annotator Register Plugin

    Assuming you have created the generator described in the
    {{{./tutorial.html}tutorial}}, you'd register it with
    the annotator register like so:

%{snippet|file=src/site/java/AnnotatorPlugin.java}

* Writing a Reader Register Plugin

    I recomment taking a look at <<<plugins/reader/pdf>>> if you
    want to writer a reader plugin.

* Writing a Writer Register Plugin

    If you plan on writing a text-based format, you can use
    {{{./apidocs/com/github/fhirschmann/clozegen/lib/components/JCasFileWriter.html}JCasFileWriter}} and pass it a
    {{{./apidocs/com/github/fhirschmann/clozegen/lib/components/api/JCasFormatter.html}JCasFormatter}}. The code below shows the
    {{{./apidocs/com/github/fhirschmann/clozegen/lib/formatters/PlainTextFormatter.html}PlainTextFormatter}}.

%{snippet|id=PTFormatter|file=lib/src/main/java/com/github/fhirschmann/clozegen/lib/formatters/PlainTextFormatter.java}

    You could now register your plugin with the writer
    register like so:

%{snippet|file=src/site/java/WriterPlugin.java}
