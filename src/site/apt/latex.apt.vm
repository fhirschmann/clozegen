LaTex Manual

    ClozeGen supports outputting LaTeX. You'll first need to
    {{{https://raw.github.com/fhirschmann/clozegen/master/lib/src/main/resources/latex/clozetest.sty}download}}
    the ClozeGen LaTeX Package and put it in the same directory as
    the LaTeX ClozeGen generates.
    Let us assume the following LaTex was generated by ClozeGen:

---
He can't think \clozeitem{of}{about, for, in, of} anything.
---

    Then you could write a template like this (assuming
    <<<output.tex>>> was generated):

---
\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{clozetest}
\begin{document}

\input{output}

\end{document}
---

    and translate it using <pdflatex> and achieve the following result:

[./images/tex/a.png]

    by setting

---
\booltrue{clozesolutions}
---
    you can then show the answer options:

[./images/tex/b.png]
